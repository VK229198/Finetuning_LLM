# Hands on FineTuning LLMs
## Description
Trying hands on with LLMs to put the theory to work and also recapping on PyTorch basics and HuggingFace systems.
A part of Learning
## Outcomes
The results are nothing to write home about. The base model was not that far off from finetuned model, however, learning to implement:
- finetuning basics
- a/b testing
- pytorch for LLMs
- huggingface models for tokenizing and using the base models
- learnt the effects of free open source LLMs and how to use them
- In fact saw in real time how finetuning helps us evolve a LLM to better suit a particular task
